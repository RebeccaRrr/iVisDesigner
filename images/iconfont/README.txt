This folder contains the sources for our icon font.

There are one or more pdf files which can be opened and edited with Adobe Illustrator.
To create the font, first use Adobe Illustrator's "Save As" function to save each pdf
file into SVG files for the artboards with "Use Artboards" checked.

Since Adobe Illustrator is proprietary software,
the output svg files are included in the source distribution for people without
Adobe Illustrator to build the project correctly.
Thus, do not edit these SVG files directly, edit the PDF and export them instead.
