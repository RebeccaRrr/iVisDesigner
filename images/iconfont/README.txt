This folder contains the sources for our icon font.

There are one or more pdf files which can be opened and edited with Adobe Illustrator.
To create the font, first use Adobe Illustrator's "Save As" function to save each pdf
file into SVG files for the artboards with "Use Artboards" checked.
Then run "python create.py" in this folder.

Since Adobe Illustrator is proprietary software,
the output file, ivfont.css is included in the source distribution for people without
Adobe Illustrator to build the project correctly.
